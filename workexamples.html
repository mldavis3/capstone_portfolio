              <h2>Writing Example 1</h2>
                  <p>Below is a link to one of the first writing assignments I did at UALR. It was written to describe how many of the songs we listen to
                  often have more meaning to them then we realize.</p>

              <h2>Writing Example 2</h2>
                  <p>Below is a link to a research based policy argument I completed for my Composition II class. The goal was to find a policy that we disagreed
                  with and construct an argument against it using tangible research. The topic I chose weres the policies put into place to incorporate more technology
                  into classrooms, without leading initiatives to increase the teachers' understanding of those technologies.</p>

        <div id="WebProject" class="tabcontent">
              <h2>Web Project 1</h2>
              <p>Below is a link to the website I created as a part of my final project for my Ethics in the Profession class.</p>

              <p>Below is a link to a PDF Database ER Diagram I created based on a prompt with some key attributes and relationships.</p>

              <h2>Database Project 2</h2>
              <p>For my Trends in Database Technologies class, I was tasked with created a database using diagrams and SQL programming. Below are two links, one for the
              Relationship Diagram and one for a text file containing the SQL code.</p>

        <div id="Programming" class="tabcontent">
              <h2>Programming Project 1</h2>
              <p>During my Sophomore year at UALR, I took Human-Computer Interfaces. This class was to learn how to create programs for end users as opposed to programs
              that run in the background. Below is a file that contains the build of the completed program I created. This program allowed for user interaction to add and 
              remove contractors and assign them to projects.</p>

        <div id="SoftSkills" class="tabcontent">
              <h2>Soft Skills Project 1</h2>
              <p>One of my soft skills that I was able to develop during my Intro to Communications course was better verbal communication, specifically 
              in front of a group of people. The assignment attached is a self-reflection worksheet that I completed to allow me to better understand my 
              strengths and weaknesses with giving presentations.</p>

              <h2>Soft Skills Project 2</h2>
              <p>Another soft skill I was able to develop was my active listening skills. I accomplished this by completing and interview assignment. During the 
              interview process I had to make sure that I was not only following along to what the person was saying, but also how they were saying it to understand
              how to respond appropriately and which questions to ask next.</p>

        <div id="Capstone" class="tabcontent">
              <h2>Capstone Project</h2>
              <p>For my Capstone Project, I used a project I am working on during my internship with the Arkansas Electric Cooperative Corporation. THe main goal
              of this project is to find and evaluate monitoring software that can be used to reliably and effeciantly monitor the thousands of devces that AECC has 
              across its network that spans many campuses, plants, and substations. Out of 7 possible choices, we selected two to continue testing. After each is tested
              thoroughly, it will be compared aginst the SolarWinds software that is already in place. After the comparison, we will either choose the new software or 
              stick with SolarWinds.</p>
